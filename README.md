# MAIN ANALYSIS TYPES: LINEAR AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION

**LOGISTIC REGRESSION**

**GRADED TASK**

-----

**Your task is to create a logistic regression model and to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).**

The data is given in the sheet Heart_desease. 

The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. 

The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. 

It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. The data attributes are described in Heart_desease_desc sheet.

**Notice:** 

XLminer can do Logistic regression just with 1000 rows of data in Google spreadsheets. 

To avoid this bug you have some other options:

1. Use Solver 
2. Use Excel 
3. Cut data to 1000 rows
4. Use any other statistical tool to create Logistic regression model

-----

**Requirements:**
1. Create a logistic regression model and estimate predictions.
2. Interpret models' coefficients and Odd ratios.
3. Assess the model with performance metrics.

-----

**Evaluation criteria:**

1. How well the model creation in the task description is followed.
2. You can explain how you selected the best model.
3. You can interpret the models' performance metrics and parameters.
4. You present fluent and clearly. Presentation should take 10-15 minutes.
5. Analytical approach to the problem.
